# Mediator

Mediator is a tool to translate netconf message from controller to device. Since there is no unified implementation standard for the YANG model of different manufacturers, it is necessary to convert the messages generated by different models.

Applications can use mediator to translate messages from different YANG models to the one that be be understood by device. Mediator also provides python language API for 3rd developers to design their own translate scripts.
