# Mediator

Mediator is a framework to facilitate the translation of netconf/xml messages instantiated from different YANG models. Mediator provides python language APIs for 3rd developers to design their own translate scripts.

Mediator can be integrated with Ansible plugin, or interacts with network controller through netconf protocol, to build the communication between the controller and diverse devices from different manufacturers.
