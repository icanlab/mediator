# Mediator

Mediator is a framework to provide APIs to translate netconf message from controller to device. Since there is no unified implementation standard for the YANG model of different manufacturers, it is necessary to convert the messages generated by different models.

Mediator provides API to Ansible plugin which  can connect ansible and mediator, or interacts with controller through netconf protocol. Mediator also provides python language API for 3rd developers to design their own translate scripts.
